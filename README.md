# In-Memory Key-Value Store
This solution offers a In-Memory Key-Value Store to hold and host any kind of string Key with serialized obejct value in server memory. 

The Project follows TDD approach and is build in ASP.NET WEB API, MVC and Angular JS.

The WEB API offers following Concurrent Store Operations in an asynchronous manner:

  i.   The Put operation associates a given value to a given key in a given namespace.

  ii.  The Get operation returns the value which is associated to a given key in a given namespace.

  iii. The Delete operation removes the association of any value to a given key in a given namespace.

  iv.  The Values operation returns a collection of all values which are associated to any keys in a given namespace.
